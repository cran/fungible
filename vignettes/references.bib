The perturbation matrix is chosen in such a manner that a class of discrepancy functionsF(Σ*0, Σ(γ0)), which includes normal theory maximum likelihood as a special case, has the prespecified parameter value γ0 as minimizer and a prespecified minimum δ A matrix constructed in this way seems particularly valuable for Monte Carlo experiments as the covariance matrix for a population in which the model does not hold exactly. This may be a more realistic conceptualization in many instances. An example is presented in which this procedure is employed to generate a covariance matrix among nonnormal, ordered categorical variables which is then used to study the performance of a factor analysis estimator.}, number={3}, journal={Psychometrika}, author={Cudeck, Robert and Browne, Michael W.}, year={1992}, month={Sep}, pages={357–369}, language={en} }
